# Enhanced Crafting Vanilla

A datapack that adds crafting recipes for vanilla items to make every day life a bit easier.

This datapack adds crafting and smelting recipes that should be in the game by default. It does this in a way that makes sense, is balanced and maintains the overal amount of items and experience recieved per resource.
